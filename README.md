# Development Requirements		
		
+	Find a problem worth solving, analyzing, or visualizing. 
+	Use ML in the context of techonologies learned.
+	You must use: Scikit-Learn and/or another machone learning library. 
+	Use Matplotlib to create a total of 6–8 visualizations of your data (ideally, at least 2 per ”question” you ask of your data). 
+	Save PNG images of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team, and for inclusion in your presentation. 
+	(Optional) Use at least one API, if you can find an API with data pertinent to your primary research questions. 
+	Create a write-up summarizing your major findings. This should include a heading for each “question” you asked of your data and a short description of your findings and any relevant plots.
		
# Presentation 	
		
+	15-minute project overview
+	Questions we found interesting and what motivated our answer 
+	Where and how we found the data and how we used this information to answer these questions
+	The data exploration and cleanup process (accompanied by our Jupyter Notebooks)
+	The analysis process (accompanied by your Jupyter Notebook)
+	Our conclusions, which should include a numerical summary and visualizations of that summary
+	The implications of our findings: what do our findings mean?
