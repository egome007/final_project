# Development Requirements		
		
+	Use Pandas to clean and format your dataset(s). 
+	Create a Jupyter Notebook describing the data exploration and cleanup process.
+	Create a Jupyter Notebook illustrating the final data analysis. 
+	Use Matplotlib to create a total of 6–8 visualizations of your data (ideally, at least 2 per ”question” you ask of your data). 
+	Save PNG images of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team, and for inclusion in your presentation. 
+	(Optional) Use at least one API, if you can find an API with data pertinent to your primary research questions. 
+	Create a write-up summarizing your major findings. This should include a heading for each “question” you asked of your data and a short description of your findings and any relevant plots.
		
# Presentation Requirements 	
		
+	10-minute project overview
+	Questions you found interesting and what motivated you to answer them
+	Where and how you found the data you used to answer these questions
+	The data exploration and cleanup process (accompanied by your Jupyter Notebook)
+	The analysis process (accompanied by your Jupyter Notebook)
+	Your conclusions, which should include a numerical summary and visualizations of that summary
+	The implications of your findings: what do your findings mean?
